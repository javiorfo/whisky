# nycta
*:new_moon: nycta is a dark Leftwm and Polybar under Arch Linux.*

## Caveats
- nycta needs [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) and several libraries to be installed (the installation script resolves this). 
- This project has been developed on and for Linux following open source philosophy.

## Installation
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/javiorfo/nycta
$ cd nycta
$ ./nycta.sh
```
- `./nycta.sh` will install **Ubuntu Mono Nerd Font** (if not installed), set **00-keyboard.conf** with LATAM distribution (if you like), and it will install [Leftwm](https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm) (from AUR) and [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) (among others).
