# nyctowm
*:new_moon: nyctowm is a nyctophilliac window manager under Arch Linux with Leftwm and Polybar.*

## Caveats
- nyctowm needs [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) and several libraries to be installed (the installation script resolves this). 
- This project has been developed on and for Linux following open source philosophy.

## Installation
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/javiorfo/nyctowm
$ cd nyctowm
$ ./nycto.sh
```
- `./nycto.sh` will install **Ubuntu Mono Nerd Font** (if not installed), set **00-keyboard.conf** with LATAM distribution (if you like), and it will install lefwm (from AUR) and polybar (among others).
